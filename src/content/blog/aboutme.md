Hey, I'm Oliver ðŸ‘‹

## My values

I believe that software developers have the ability to make the world a better place by creating code that is intuitive, inclusive and accessible.

I want to use my skills to have a positive impact.

In 2022 I reverted to Islam, and as a Muslim my primary objective in this life is to worship God by doing good deeds and seeking knowledge.

## My tech origin story

All the way back in the early days of the internet, I was selected to participate in a Microsoft study focused on young internet users. This experience sparked my enthusiasm for all things tech and opened my eyes to the exciting world of code and software development.

## My interests

The internet, charity work, DEI, accessibility, literature, philosophy, politics, health and diet.

## Connecting

Please feel free to schedule a call with me or message me about anything, I'd love the opportunity to connect.
