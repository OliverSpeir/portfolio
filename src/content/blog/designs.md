Images of variations and thoughts about basic UI elements that I like

## Theme Selectors

1. Drop downs
    - More clicks, but more clear what's happening
2. Switches
    - Clear what's happening but missing the system default option
3. Toggle buttons
    - Not always clear whats happening
    - Does the icon represent the current theme or the theme that it will go to?
    - Does it toggle between three states?
