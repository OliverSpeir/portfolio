# Making accessibility accessible

I've recently taken a keen interest in accessibility, and here I'll keep some notes for myself and others. Please let me know if you have any good resources or thoughts.

## First impressions

I've noticed that WCAG is very dense, and I can somewhat forgive this as it is an international standard. Despite assuming it would need to be exhaustive and somewhat beaucratic, I'm still surprised.

## Tools

Tools are important.

[Lighthouse](https://pagespeed.web.dev) was my introduction to accessibility.

I spent some time looking for other options, and found [deque-labs/axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) powers Lighthouse's accessibility tests.

What I really wanted was a full audit, instead of one that left me with "manually check x, y and z".

[Wave webaim](https://wave.webaim.org/) is pretty cool as well, but they add rules outside of WCAG which is fine but it can make it confusing if you're just looking to adhere to WCAG.

[guidepup](https://github.com/guidepup/guidepup) This tool looks very cool, although I haven't had a chance to look into it much yet.

I have a feeling something very thorough could be created with playwright, although it would be a fair bit of work. One could go through and test the things that lighthouse suggests to test manually.

_I'm still on the hunt as of now..._

## Solutions

I've noticed that one a relatively common solution is [accessibe's widget](https://accessibe.com/accesswidget). This uses ai to create image alt text (usually not a good choice, most images shouldn't have an alt) and will basically override the design of the website to meet user's requirements.

I don't love this option, because I feel it makes the fancy design for people who don't need assistance. What I'd want is for well designed creative websites to be made accessible by default.

I do like that it gives option for sites that cannot afford to redesign with WCAG in mind to meet minimum requirements ASAP.

I guess the best solution I know of is to pay for a manual audit, or as a developer to learn what it takes to become an auditor for your own sites
