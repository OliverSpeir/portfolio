# Making accessibility accessible

I've recently taken a keen interest in accessibility, and here I'll keep some notes for myself and others.

## First impressions

I've noticed that WCAG is very dense, and I can somewhat forgive this as it is an international standard. Despite assuming it would need to be exhaustive and somewhat beaucratic, I'm still surprised.

## Tooling

As a developer, I'm very aware of the power of tooling. 

My real introduction in accessibility was [Lighthouse](https://pagespeed.web.dev). This took me a long way, and remains integral to my process. 

I spent some time looking for other options, and found deque-labs and found they maintain the tools that power Lighthouse's accessibility tests. 

What I really wanted was a full audit, instead of one that left me with "manually check x, y and z"

## Solutions

I've noticed that one a relatively common solution is tools similar to accessibe's plugin. This plugin adds alt text to images, gives option to force contrast ratios, halt animations etc. 

I don't love this option, because I feel it takes away from people who need these tools. What I'd want is for well designed creative websites to be made accessible by default.
