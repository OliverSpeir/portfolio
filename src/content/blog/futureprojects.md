Some project ideas I'd like to get to eventually in no particular order

## Astro

- Remote images in `.md` and `.mdx` with `![]()` syntax
- Picture element in `.md` with `![]()`
- Compression presets for images
- Dev Tool Bar App that does browser dev tools inspect
  - Allows for goto file
- Dev Tool Bar App that runs [dequelabs/axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)
- Integration that validates links at build time
- tsc and terser for inline scripts
  - Complicated because astro language server won't see them that way

## CMS

- Create git based CMS for Astro that runs the dev server in a [web container](https://webcontainers.io)
  - Support for MDX
